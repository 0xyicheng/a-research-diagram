# OutlineÔΩúEthereum's Consensus Protocol

### What is Consensus

#### Background
+ The Byzantine Generals Problem
    + Background
        + In a 1982 [paper](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf), **Leslie Lamport** 
        + Basic idea: abstract
    + The problem
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZguVyxt.png)
        + The army are **divided** into several generals
        + Generals communicate **only** through **messenger**
        + Generals must decide **a common plan** of action
        + Howevery, some of generals are **traitors**, trying to **prevent** the loyal generals from **reaching agreement**
        + The generals must have an **algorithm** to guaranteeüëá
            1. All loyal generals decide upon the **same plan** of action (attack or retreat)
            2. A small number of traitors **cannot** cause the loyal generals to **adopt a bad plan**
    + The definitions
        + BGP
            + as aboveüëÜ
        + BFT
            + Byzantine faults
                + traitor generals
                + malicious nodes
            + Byzantine fault tolerant
                + Any algorithms that can tolerate Byzantine faults
            + Some BFT algorithms
                + \> 51% general votes algorithm

                    + consists of one leader node (sending requests) and backup nodes (voting)
                    + Communication is fast. All nodes reach the result at the same time (but the number of nodes cannot be too many)
                    + High barriers to entry (participant list)
                    + Can tolerate Byzantine faults, allowing the 33% malicious nodes

+ Sybil attack
    + The definition
        + An attack by creating vast numbers of **duplicate identities** at a low (or zero) cost
    + Example
        + Background
            + \> 51% algorithm
            + If you run a software (open sourced) you can be a general and **vote**
        + Execute attack
            + You can make **many virtual machines** and run this "general software"
            + And control voting of all machines
            + Now you create many duplicate identities at a very low cost
            + Vote, take over the system

### What is the consensus protocol of Ethereum

#### Background
+ Safety and Liveness
    + Background
        + Derived from CAP Theorem
            + client-servers model
            + Consistency, Availability, Partition-tolerance
        + CAP Theorem beacomes a more general framework
            + The impossibility of guaranteeing both safety and liveness in an unreliable distributed system
            + safety, liveness, unreliable
    + Safety
        + The definition
            + Informally, an algorithm is safe if nothing bad ever happens
        + In blockchain context
            + Consistency
                + If we were to ask different (honest) nodes about **the state of the chain** at some point, then we should always get **the same answer**, no matter which node we ask
                + The blockchain transaction history will not contain two **conflicting** blocks
    + Liveness
        + The definition
            + By contrast, an algorithm is live if eventually something good happens
        + In blockchain context
            + The chain can always add a new block
    + In practice
        + Ethereum prioritises liveness
        + Bitcoin only has Liveness guarantee, no Safety guarantee

#### General intro
+ General intro
    + The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum consensus protocol is constructed by applying the finality gadget **Casper FFG** on top of the fork choice rule **LMD-GHOST**
+ Reference
    + Three Attacks on Proof-of-Stake Ethereum [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10086.pdf) (introduction part)
    + Gasper [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437.pdf)

#### Fork-choice rule
+ The defination
    + The fork-choice rule is the rule for **choosing a branch** when a blockchain **fork** ocuurs
    + Subsequent blocks will be added to this chain (branch)
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/bQfPoNw.png)
+ Bitcoin and PoW Ethereum's fork-choice rule
    + They use **the longest chain rule**
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/OoBH5N9.png)
    + The longest chain represents **the most cumulative "work" done** under proof of work
    + New blocks continue to be **added** to the longest chain (highest block), which is "liveness" too
+ GHOST
    + The background
        + GHOST was proposed in a 2015 [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf) to improve Bitcoin's fork choice rules
        + Many people say that GHOST is also used in PoW Ethereum, but Ethereum **never** actually implemented it
    + The definition
        + The **heaviest chain rules**, the chain with the most votes becomes the **canonical chain**
+ LMD-GHOST
    + The background
        + LMD-GHOST is a variant of GHOST that only considers the latest vote (LMD = latest message driven)
        + Proposed in a 2017 [paper](https://github.com/vladzamfir/research/blob/master/papers/CasperTFG/CasperTFG.pdf), V.zamfir tries to combine GHOST with Casper
    + The definition
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/5rwqLht.png)
        + Calculate the block with **the most votes**, return it as **the head of the chain**, and add subsequent blocks to this block
        + Number of votes = block + it's descendants
    + The workflow
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/BDuvAhZ.png)
        + Start at the genesis block
        + Each time there is a fork, **choose** the block‚Äôs subtree where more of LMs (latest messages) are supported
        + Repeat, until you research a block **with no children** then return this block as the head of the chain

#### Finality gadget
+ Safety
    + Bitcoin and PoW Ethereum have no "finality gadget" and ‚Äúsecurity guarantees‚Äù
        + Whoever constructs the new longest chain can change the previous blocks
    + Under the Casper FFG, the finalized block of PoS Ethereum cannot be modified
        + Requires huge attack cost, $\frac{2}{3}$ of the total staking amount
+ Casper FFG
    + The background
        + Based on the pBFT algorithm, but with many new features
            + Punishment mechanism
                + slashing conditions
            + Permissionless system
                + dynamic validators
            + Modular overlay
                + clean and have a modular design
    + Main components
        + Checkpoint tree
            + Casper is designed to work with a wide class of **blockchain protocols** with **tree-like structures**
            + Checkpoint tree
                + Checkpoint block
                    + The blocks whose height is a multiple of a constant H
                    + For example, H = 100, blocks = 0, 100, 200, 300, ...
                    + In Ethereum, H = 32
                + Checkpoint tree
                    ![](https://i.imgur.com/WPBiM6r.png)
                    + Finality on Checkpoint blocks
                    + Checkpoint blocks form a Checkpoint tree
            + Future: single slot
                + There is a research direction to reduce H to 1
                + In this way, each block (slot) is a checkpoint block
                + Can speed up finality time (from 32 slots to 1 slots, 384s to 12s)
        + Checkpoints pair
            + The definition
                ![](https://i.imgur.com/NgNNtzo.png)
                + $checkpoint(s,t)$
                    + The pair is a link from source checkpoint to target checkpoint 
                    + Pair is the content of validator votes (i.e. attestations)
            + Supermajority Link
                + Pairs with $\frac{2}{3}$ staker votes
        + Justification and Finalization
            + Genesis Block
                + The genesis block is justified/finalized by default
            + Justification
                + a checkpoint $c$ is called justified if 
                    + (1) it is root
                    + (2)there exits a supermajority link $c' \to c$ where checkpoint $c'$ is **justified**
            + Finalization
                + a checkpoint $c$ is finalized if and only if
                    + (1) it is root
                    + (2) checkpoint $c$ is **justified**, and there exits a supermajority link $c \to c'$, checkpoints $c$ and $c'$ are not conflicting, and $h(c')=h(c)+1$ 
                + Finalized blocks as part of the canonical chain
        + Slashing conditions
            + Note
                + Validator violations will be punished
                + All violating validators can be traced (by signature)
            + The definition
                ![](https://i.imgur.com/oA4a9VI.png)
                + A validator must not publish two distinct votes for the same target height
                + A validator must not vote within the span of other votes
